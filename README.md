Overview
--------

WizarDroid.NET is a lightweight library that makes it easy to implement wizards in Xamarin.Android applications.

Key advantages:

* Offers a built-in basic wizard layout with wizard navigation controls.
* Supports automatic state propagation/preservation between wizard steps
* Supports the concept of required steps, preventing the user from navigating forward until a necessary action is completed.
* Customizable, allows definition of additional layouts.

Refer to the bundle sample project for the implementation details.   Updated documentation coming soon...
